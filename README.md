# bookit
Website in react

If you have issues try uinstalling the depedencies and npm i again. Nodemon seems to cause issues sometimes.

Terminal:

in bookit write:
npm i 

cd client

in client write:
npm i

#### npm run dev 

in the terminal to run both server and react client

nodemon is installed to autorefresh on website changes
